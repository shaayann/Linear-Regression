# Per Capita Income Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective:

To predict per capita income based on year using Linear Regression.

## Dataset:

### Columns:

year (Independent variable)

per capita income (US$) (Dependent variable)

Data Source: Kaggle or manually created dataset

## Approach:

### Data Preprocessing:

Checked for missing values and data types.

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

### Model Training:

Applied Linear Regression to find the best-fit line.

### Model Evaluation:

Used R² score, MAE, MSE, RMSE to assess performance.

### Visualizations:

Regression Line Plot → Shows trend over time.

Actual vs. Predicted Scatter Plot → Checks model accuracy.

Residual Plot → Analyzes errors.

## Outcome:

Model Equation: Income = (Coefficient × Year) + Intercept

The model helps forecast future per capita income based on past trends.
